This project is an attempt to create a system that can read the handwriting
of handwritten notes in order to decipher old notebooks. Current iterations are using
Tesseract to do OCR, but this does not work well at all with cursive handwriting,
or handwriting in general.

Next steps forward
- We can try to train tesseract on generalized cursive handwriting
- Attempting to train tesseract on specific people's handwriting  (if the notebooks are a single person)
- Use a system to preprocess handwriting in a way that is easier to tesseract to read
- Find a different system that can do handwriting ocr better.
